# Healthcare_Monitoring_and_Performance_Dashboard_using_Power_BI

### *Project Description*

#### *Summary*  
I developed a Power BI dashboard titled *"Healthcare Monitoring and Performance Dashboard"*, designed to provide comprehensive insights into healthcare costs, coverage, diagnosis trends, and performance metrics. The dashboard spans five interactive pages with navigation buttons, advanced visualizations, KPIs, and filters to enable efficient monitoring and data-driven decision-making. By leveraging DAX calculations and conditional formatting, it delivers actionable insights for improved healthcare management and performance tracking.

#### *Key Insights*  
1. *Summary and KPI Overview*:  
   - **Page 1** provides a quick overview with KPIs such as Cost, Coverage, and Out-of-Pocket Expense.  
   - Visualizations include Diagnosis Cost by Departments in a bar chart and Gender-based Diagnosis Cost in a pie chart.  
   - Interactive filters for claim status, gender, diagnosis type, and treatment type enhance user engagement and provide tailored insights.  

2. *Data Analysis and Filtering*:  
   - **Page 2** focuses on detailed data analysis with a table showcasing essential information.  
   - Features include data bars, icons, and conditional formatting, alongside DAX-calculated Expense Categories.  
   - Filters for admission date, discharge date, insurance provider, and expense category allow precise data exploration and analysis.  

3. *Gender-Based Analysis*:  
   - **Page 3** offers insights into gender-based cost and coverage trends, represented through bar charts and gauge meters.  
   - Visualizations include:  
     - Coverage-Cost comparison in a gauge meter.  
     - Cost-Coverage and Out-of-Pocket Expenses in a donut chart.  
     - Gender-based Out-of-Pocket and Coverage Amount in a stacked bar chart.  
     - Cost trends visualized in a stacked bar line chart.  

4. *Diagnosis and Performance Analysis*:  
   - **Page 4** focuses on diagnosis data by doctors, hospitals, and age groups.  
   - Key visualizations include:  
     - Diagnosis rankings by doctors in a funnel chart.  
     - Diagnosis by age category in a column chart (with age grouped into bins).  
     - Diagnosis trends by hospitals in an area chart.  

5. *QA and Decomposition Tree*:  
   - **Page 5** features QA insights and a decomposition tree to break down data for root cause analysis.  
   - This page allows users to identify and resolve underlying issues effectively, ensuring better healthcare performance monitoring.  

#### *Key Benefits*  
The *Healthcare Monitoring and Performance Dashboard* consolidates critical healthcare data to:  
- Monitor costs, coverage, and out-of-pocket expenses across departments, diagnoses, and genders.  
- Explore gender-based trends in cost, coverage, and expenses with interactive filters and charts.  
- Analyze diagnosis rankings by doctors and hospitals and uncover age-group-based trends.  
- Use a decomposition tree to investigate and resolve healthcare performance issues.  
- Enable efficient navigation across pages, ensuring a seamless user experience.  

#### *Tools and Technologies Used*  
- **Power BI Desktop**: For developing dynamic and interactive dashboards.  
- **DAX**: For creating advanced calculations, conditional formatting, and customized metrics.  
- **Data Visualization Techniques**: To design intuitive and engaging visuals like bar charts, pie charts, and gauge meters.  
- **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)**: For efficient data integration and preprocessing.  

This project demonstrates how Power BI can be leveraged to monitor and optimize healthcare performance. By integrating advanced visualizations, navigation features, and DAX-based analytics, the dashboard provides stakeholders with actionable insights to improve decision-making and healthcare outcomes.
